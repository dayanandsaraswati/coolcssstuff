# coolcssstuff
This Repo contains some of the cool CSS effects that I have learned during my practices with the language.

This page contains some cool stuffs that you may want to include in your website to give them cool effects.

Please feel free to clone and use them to your own purposes.

The code written are not entirely my own. They have been inspired by a lot of online CSS coders.I respect and thank them, sorry couldn't list all of your names, but I thank you all humbly.

Few of the effects are:

 1. Image Splitting effect
 	This is a very cool thumnail effect in which the background image splits to give you the underlying 		text. This can be used in a number ofm places in your websites or web projects. 
 
 
Please feel free to use any of the effects in your page as per your need.

My only suggestion will be that please don't over-do the effects, it looks a bit pushy.

If you have some suggestions, please modify them and create a pull requests.

Again I am not the best CSS designer in the world. So please go through other sites as well and see if you can find something more interesting. And if you do please share it with me too. :)
